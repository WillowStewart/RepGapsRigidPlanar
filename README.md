# Representations Gaps of Rigid Planar Diagram Monoids
This repository collects all code used for the paper "Representations Gaps of Rigid Planar Diagram Monoids." The Mathematica code was mainly used for calculations of asymptotics in the paper itself, whilst the GAP code was mainly for exploratory analysis of the monoids involved.
