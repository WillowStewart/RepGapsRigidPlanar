# Representations Gaps of Rigid Planar Diagram Monoids
This repository collects all code used for the paper "Representations Gaps of Rigid Planar Diagram Monoids." The Mathematica code was mainly used for calculations of asymptotics in the paper itself, whilst the GAP code was mainly for exploratory analysis of the monoids involved. 

Cell_Structures_GAP.txt explains how to produce the images of Green's relations for various monoids that appear in the paper. One can use the monoids defined in the other GAP code, or other monoids, to produce similar images. 

Note that, unlike in the paper, we do consider odd n for our computations and do not use the 2n definition of the rigid planar monoids.
